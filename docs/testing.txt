                            ======Parsing Testing======
    Parsing from the file was tested after every line was read in from the file.
    The printf lines were placed directly after the sscanf line and ncurses was
    not enabled until parsing was perfected. Before the variables were assigned,
    the cases would have a printf that would print what it was to the screen.
    After parsing branched information into different variables the printf's advanced
    to hold the information that was just parsed into.

                            ======Room Drawing Testing======
    Drawing from the information that was parsed above was pretty simple. Due to the 
    fact that the same drawing function is used for every room, no value is hardcoded 
    into the function. Printf statements were used to make sure that if statements and
    loops are executing correctly. 

                            ======Hero Actions Testing  ======
    Testing the input for the hero was a bit more challenging. Many if cases and switches
    are used in there. Thus, many print statements were used to make sure that these are 
    executing. After movement works print statements became obselete due to the fact that
    the hero is moving and the errors are noticeable from the movement. 

                            ======Room Input File Testing ======
    Throught testing the program I used two files. One file would be the rooms with maximum
    dimensions (fullTestRooms) and the other file was rooms with random dimensions and every
    item possible (testRooms). Errors in the parsing and drawing were caught from either the
    printf statements along the way as detailed above or by eyeballing the location of the 
    items in the dungeon to the file. The second testing file was used the most due to it being
    the obscure case with the most amount of variants. This file also has all the items popssible 
    in the first five rooms. The sixth room is to make sure that its not reliable on
